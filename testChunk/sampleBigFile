With the holiday season almost upon us, 
we hope you have already booked some leaves 
for the remaining year and if not, 
we encourage you to consider taking 
some time off to recharge and 
spend time with your family 
and friends. If you are unable to utilise 
all the annual leaves during this 
calendar year, you can also carry 
forward some of them to next year. 
The maximum unused annual leaves 
that can be carried forward 
to the next year is 
45 days
